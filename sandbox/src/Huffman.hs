-- Tests:

-- $(inv 'encode) is not the right choice for the definition for a decoding function.
-- The (correct) inverse of encode would be a function that returns pairs of codemaps and words that would result in the given codeword.
-- However, there would be an infinite number of solutions for this.
-- For a decoding function, we want to use the knowledge of the codemap to decode the codeword.
-- We can do so by using the partially inverted function of encode, where we fix the codemap argument.
-- Therefore, we use the following definition:
-- let decode = $(partialInv 'encode [0]) codemap in decode codeword

-- We provide the same test with primitive types. It works fine, but it is a lot slower than the version with the custom type.
-- let decodePrimitive = $(partialInv 'encode [0]) codemapPrimitive in decodePrimitive codewordPrimitive

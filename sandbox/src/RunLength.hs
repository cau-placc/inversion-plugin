-- TODO: often functions are pseudo-inverses. for example, the functions rle and unrle are not inverses of each other. unrleInv yields "unexpected" results, like tuples with zero and ('a', 1), ('a', 1) instead of ('a', 2)

--other examples are words/unwords, lines/unlines. zip/unzip. all those functions are not injective.
--(uncurry zip . unzip) gilt, lines "a", "a\n", words mehrere leerzeichen
